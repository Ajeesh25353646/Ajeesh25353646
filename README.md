Hi there, I’m Ajeesh

My journey in ML began began during my Erasmus Mundus Masters program. This was the place where I got the opputunity to apply various ML algorithms and perform data analysis on massive CERN datasets.

Throughout the program, my passion for ML kept increasing. That interest pushed me to go beyond the standard curriculum and made me took some extra courses to deepen my understanding and learn more about the technology.

My current expertise lies in dealing with complex statistical datasets. In addition to that, I enjoy exploring transformer-based architectures and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. I’m also experienced with building AI agents by using tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and building end-to-end LLM applications.

In addition to core ML frameworks, I use combination of streamlit, Docker and AWS for the deployment.
